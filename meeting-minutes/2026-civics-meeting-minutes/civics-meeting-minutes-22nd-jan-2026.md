LM confirmed technical difficulties persist.</td><td>Election extended until Monday. Plan B is to vote during the next meeting if the portal remains broken.</td></tr><tr><td>CC Election Responsibilities</td><td>TL discussed the option of Intersect governance team handling preparations for the next CC election to save volunteer resources, rather than spinning up a new working group.</td><td>Committee generally agreed. NC requested a RACI matrix and process document to formalize the handover.</td></tr><tr><td>Mandatory Credentials</td><td>TL proposed making credential generation a mandatory step for candidacy to avoid chasing winners post-election.</td><td>TL demoed a new registration portal v2.0 with step-by-step guides.</td></tr><tr><td>CAP Working Group Update</td><td>LM reported on the merge of "Process" and "Tooling" phases. The group adopted a baseline process using a GitHub repo and a new front-end portal.</td><td>New members joined following an X Space. </td></tr><tr><td>Governance Education</td><td>AS presented a Gap Analysis template to organize existing educational materials. Discussion followed on the need for cultural adaptation and reaching newcomers.</td><td>NS requested all members fill out the governance material survey form to help map current resources.</td></tr><tr><td>Committee Role &#x26; Impact</td><td>NC and KO discussed whether committees should be "executors" or "advisory boards." There is a push to move toward an advisory model where professional staff handle the heavy lifting.</td><td>NC noted the 500 ADA stipend is not a salary and doesn't cover full-time execution work.</td></tr><tr><td>Funding &#x26; Budgeting</td><td>NC expressed that the Civics Committee needs dedicated funding in the Intersect budget to avoid relying on "exploited free labor."</td><td>LM noted that budget lines for committees are a hard sell for the ecosystem-wide vote.</td></tr><tr><td>Member Accountability</td><td>WB (Observer) shared concerns regarding elected members who commit 10 hours in applications but only deliver 2 hours once elected.</td><td>WB suggested a framework for results should be in place before payments are issued to ensure accountability.</td></tr><tr><td>X Spaces Strategy</td><td>The committee discussed increasing the frequency of X Spaces. RI suggested weekly sessions to manage community expectations and provide feedback.</td><td>Next X Space planned for two weeks' time, focusing on Governance Education. NS to host.</td></tr><tr><td>Content Scheduling</td><td>LM re-introduced a "Content Scheduler" document to organize social media outreach and "get to know you" posts for committee members.</td><td>Members are encouraged to submit short bios via the Google Drive link for promotion on the Civics X account.</td></tr></tbody></table>
