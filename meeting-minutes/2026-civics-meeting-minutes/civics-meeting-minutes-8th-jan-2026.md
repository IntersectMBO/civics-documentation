## Decisions/Actions

The Civics Committee meeting on January 8, 2026, resulted in several key decisions and action items aimed at shaping the committee's trajectory for the new year.

### Decisions Made

* GHWG Report Approval: The committee formally signed off on the Governance Health Working Group (GHWG) report for public release.
* GHWG Operational Status: It was decided that the GHWG will pause formal weekly meetings and transition to asynchronous communication until a new specific objective is proposed and approved.
* CIP49 Grant Extension: The committee reached a consensus to extend the CIP49 grant deadline one final time to January 31, 2026, rather than closing it on the 16th.

### Action Items

#### Committee Leadership

* Vice Chair Nominations: Committee members are tasked with submitting their candidacy for the Vice Chair position via the Intersect Members Area over the next week.
* 2026 Strategy Planning: All members are asked to identify their areas of expertise and consider 1 or 2 primary workstreams they wish to prioritize for a dedicated strategy session next week.

#### Working Group Tasks

* CAP Testing (Phase 2/3): The Constitutional Amendment Process (CAP) working group will begin "test runs" by applying the process to existing amendment proposals (e.g., those proposed by Utah) to ensure requirements align with the built process.
* Education Rubric & Gaps: The Governance Education working group will continue developing a rubric to assess resources and aims to identify educational gaps by mid-February.
* Standardized Metrics: Following KEØ's previous suggestion, the GHWG is expected to look into defining standardized measurement methodologies for the newly approved KPIs.

#### Communication & Outreach

* CIP49 "Final Push": Civics will coordinate a final social media push on X (Twitter) on January 9th to alert wallet providers and SDK builders of the final January 31st deadline.
* GHWG Publication: The committee will initiate the public release of the health report across various channels, including a dedicated X (Twitter) Space to discuss the findings.

#### Budget & Resources

* 2026 Budget Formulation: WG leads and committee members must begin identifying concrete resource needs (for workshops, research, or grants) to draft a unified 2026 budget proposal.

The role involves supporting the Chair, organizing agendas, and attending Intersect Steering Committee meetings.</td><td>Candidates can apply via the Members Area for one week. Voting begins next week. Time commitment: 2-3 hrs/week.</td></tr><tr><td>Constitutional Amendment Process (CAP) WG</td><td>NC updated that Phase 1 is complete. The group is now entering Phase 2/3, which involves testing the process using Yuta's proposed amendments as test cases.</td><td>Goal is to ensure requirements align with the process and to document guardrails for future CAP assessors.</td></tr><tr><td>Governance Health Working Group (GHWG)</td><td>The GHWG has completed its initial report. LM showcased a new dedicated webpage for governance health reports. NC requested a formal sign-off from the committee for broad publication.</td><td>VOTE: The committee voted (9 present, 8 "Yes", 1 verbal "Yes") to publish the report and initiate an X space for discussion.</td></tr><tr><td>GHWG Future Status</td><td>NC proposed that since the working group met its charter goals, it will pause formal meetings and move to asynchronous communication until a new objective is defined.</td><td>Supports the principle that WGs should have specific tasks rather than running in perpetuity.</td></tr><tr><td>Governance Education WG</td><td>NS reported that the group has identified educational resources and is developing a rubric to assess them. Milestone 3 (identifying gaps) is expected by mid-February.</td><td>LM suggested establishing quarterly goals for better reporting, as this work is viewed as a continuous process.</td></tr><tr><td>CIP49 Grant Recap</td><td>NC and LM reviewed the 100k ADA grant for CIP49 implementation. Only one wallet integrated it, claiming 5k ADA.</td><td>The committee discussed why interest was low, suggesting a lack of priority among wallet providers.</td></tr><tr><td>CIP49 Grant Extension</td><td>NC proposed a final "push" via X. The committee debated whether to close the grant or extend it to allow those with items in the pipeline to finish.</td><td>DECISION: The deadline is extended to Jan 31, 2026. If no further claims are made, the remaining 95k ADA will be reallocated.</td></tr><tr><td>2026 Priorities &#x26; Resources</td><td>NC emphasized focusing on 1–2 high-impact workstreams rather than many small ones. He encouraged members to identify their expertise areas for a strategy session next week.</td><td>Members are encouraged to bring specific priorities to the next meeting.</td></tr><tr><td>DRep Incentives Proposal</td><td>SR proposed a new working group focused on long-term DRep and governance actor compensation, noting CIP149 is only a temporary solution.</td><td>TL noted his existing CIP on "Governance Actors Compensation" and emphasized that CC and SPOs must also be included to ensure community support.</td></tr><tr><td>2026 Budget Cycle</td><td>NC and LM discussed the necessity of a unified 2026 budget for Civics to fund workshops, research, and grants. NC noted that the "Cardano 2030" strategy includes governance KPIs that can justify funding.</td><td>WG leads are asked to begin identifying concrete resource needs for a formal budget proposal.</td></tr></tbody></table>
