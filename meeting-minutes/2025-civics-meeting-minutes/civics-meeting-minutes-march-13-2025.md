Meeting Minutes - Cardano Civics Committee (Intersect)

**Summary:**\
The meeting addressed updates on governance working streams, the selection of a proposal for the Constitutional Committee (CC) election voting tool, and a review of the CC election applicant form. Key decisions and action items were identified for future coordination and improvement of governance processes.

**Discussion Points**\
\
**Constitutional Delegates Governance Working Streams (CDGWs) Update:**\
A plan and budget proposal for governance establishment, community initiative funding, and process was presented.\
Discussions took place regarding legitimacy, clarity, and potential overlap with other initiatives.\
The potential for the initiative to serve as a unique selling point for Cardano was highlighted. The emergent nature of the work streams and the intention to involve the community in defining collaborative methods were emphasized and supported

Budget Coordination and Collaboration:\
Concerns were discussed about coordinating responsibilities and collaborating with other groups, with a step-by-step approach with demonstrable results suggested.

The use of  asynchronous collaboration and need for a coordination layer was discussed. Framing the proposal for better communication was suggested. Members of CDGWs WG were encouraged to take active roles in the upcoming elections to advance governance efforts.\
\
The committee will review materials provided from WGs and provide asynchronous feedback

**CC (Constitutional Committee) Election WG Update:**

Following WG members’ review, a specific proposal was recommended for the CC election voting tool based on its score and features. The leading proposal was for a stake-based rank-choice voting system with staggered election terms. Concerns about the timeframe and information for endorsement were raised and discussed by Civics members.

Licensing concerns were clarified, and the previous use of a similar tool was discussed.

CC Election Tool Selection Rationale:

A comparison of proposals highlighted differences between open-source tools and development team expertise. The recommended tool is open-source and improved to support stake-based voting for various applications.\
Concerns about duplication of costs when selecting a new tool were addressed.

The group discussed two proposals and made a decision based on developers' ability to deliver on time, inclusion of redundant systems, and transparency of the vendor selection process, voting to support the working group's recommendation for a specific proposal.\
The committee unanimously supported proposal two. The voting criteria were approved—state-baked ranked-choice voting for seven candidates, staggered 2+1 term, and a 73‑epoch cycle—with five votes in favor and one abstention.

The group reviewed a draft applicant form for the CC election and agreed that the questions need significant improvement.

The evolving role of the Civics Committee in the new budget process was discussed, transitioning towards a consultant or guidance role.\
