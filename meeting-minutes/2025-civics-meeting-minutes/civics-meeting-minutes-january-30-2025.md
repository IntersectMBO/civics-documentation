# Civics Meeting Minutes January 30, 2025

Welcome from the new Civics Committee Chair: [Jose Miguel De Gamboa](mailto:jmdegamboa@hagamosvaca.com)

* Thank you to Michael for his chairmanship in the past
* The new chair’s operating principle is to gather the collective intelligence and facilitate the group forward.
* Ask: For members to continue to be committed, engage and participate. There’s a lot coming up in governance.  We’ll need your participation and help.\


GovTool Budget Update

* Context: the budget proposal is related to the core governance tools. For example, Voltaire GovTool and the Constitutional Committee Portal.
* Currently 5 builders are contributing to these tools.
* GovTool purpose: a reliable option for governance tools, owned by the community.
* The working group defined the vision for 2030 and roadmap for 2025 and defined a budget for the 2025 roadmap and maintenance. This was reviewed in the meeting, as well as the proposed budget.&#x20;
* Committee members requested that the budget be edited to include clear benefits, prioritization and to break out some line items into more detail.
* There was discussion as to which committee this budget should be approved and overseen by.&#x20;
* The CCC voted and approved to take on responsibility for this budget, with the understanding that technical support and oversight could be provided by the TSC.\


Government Participation Special Interest Group (SIG) request

* The community seems to be missing a place to take conversations beyond X.
* A short timeline SIG (maybe 6months) could be a place for people to surface issues in participation in governance. They can send those concerns and ideas with well thought out discussions.
* To keep it actionable, the results can be sent to the CCC to determine any actions to take, including improved governance features.
* Discussed having physical workshops related to these issues
* It was suggested that rather than providing a new space, attend spaces where people are already engaging. Then harness those conversations so they don’t go into the void.&#x20;
* Request from the SIG proposer: a dedicated Discord channel.
* Informal support - for the CCC to know it exists and direct people to the SIG when we notice online conversations.
* It was considered wither the SIG should report to the CCC or the ISC to better solve problems surfaced.
* The CCC voted that they were happy to be the point of contact for the SIG.\


Governance Support Working Group (WG) Update

* The main focus right now is a proposed consultation process around DRep compensation. So far, proposed a series of 3 public workshops with structured facilitation to address key questions around compensation.
* Objective of DRep compensation: Broaden the participation of DReps to generate a more decentralized distribution (could be geographically or amount of stake per DRep etc).
* Workshop 1, Feb 13th, 1500 UTC - philosophy behind compensation. Hosted by the Gov Support WG.
* Workshop 2 , TBD but in March - Determine the reward scheme.
* Workshop 3, TBD but in April to determine the numbers to apply to the selected reward scheme.&#x20;
* So far, the plan is fully virtual given the timeline, but it was acknowledged that if possible, in-person gatherings would deepen the conversation.
* Should we define OKRs or goals for this process?  It’s more important the outcome of the process, rather than the scale of the process.
* Like KPIs of DRep compensation.



Ratification Working Group (WG) Updates&#x20;

* Constitution governance action is on-chain!!
* The working group has been creating content and coordinating dissemination of it.
* Educational content, media/images, translations etc.\


CC Election WG

* The first meeting was held to review the election timeline and starting thoughts.
* Flagged that the voting tool to be used will need to go through the grant process, so needs to be started very soon.
* Discussed different voting systems, and whether AI candidates should be allowed.
* Discussed whether candidates should be KYC’ed.
* Timeline: runs from now until the ICC expiration on September first.
* The design phase is set to run for the month of February.



AOB

* Reviewed the CCC meeting frequency given the volume of activities. The chair and secretary will work to revise meetings appropriately.
