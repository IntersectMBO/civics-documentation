Governance support working group update - 2025 objectives and budget review

* Reviewed the line items proposed in each of the Governance Support budget buckets
* Discussed the process for budget approval

Hard Fork Working Group (HFWG) Request

* The HFWG requested the CCC’s input as to whether a minimum threshold of DRep stake is needed for the next hard fork.
* The CCC discussed the topic, scenarios of concern, and the historical debate on the subject.  Both long term and short term concerns were discussed, and the general sentiment was that the short term concerns do not merit defining a minimum threshold of DRep stake, but innovation will be important long-term to ensure delegation to DReps works as-intended.
* It was also discussed that the Interim Constitutional Committee’s role is in the constitutionality of a hard fork. The constitution requires considering the technical guidance of experts as required in the guardrails, but there’s no constitutional requirement for a certain DRep threshold.
* The CCC will document their opinion and share it back with the HFWG.

Progress update: Constitution Ratification WG

* Interest in getting the ICC’s input on the constitution draft, potentially as a workshop to get their thoughts.
