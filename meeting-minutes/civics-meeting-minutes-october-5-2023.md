# Civics Meeting Minutes October 5, 2023

* The Cardano Civics Committee (CCC) convened this first meeting to review its remit and see how it fits into Intersect more broadly.
* The members are geographically diverse, and all share a unique interest and viewpoint on Cardano governance.
* The CCC’s purpose was discussed, and understood to be: Ensure Cardano governance is accessible, fair, transparent.
* The members discussed a first priority of facilitating the consultation period of the constitution, as part of the constitution working group within the committee.  The working group will be a coordination point for the global workshops, a constitutional convention, and arriving at a working document for the constitution.
* The committee discussed practical considerations for becoming the constitution consultation period facilitators - they want to understand the activity in the community surrounding the Cardano constitution, how to work within Intersect, the budget for these activities and find more support beyond the committee’s existing members
