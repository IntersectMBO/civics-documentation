# Civics Meeting Minutes February 8, 2024

### Review of Activities since last meeting

* Comments on the interim constitution
* Preparing for the integrated Cardano ecosystem workshop Feb 19/20.

### The committee discussed the integrated Cardano ecosystem workshop

* The focus is on process design for the vision and open source product backlog, and will capture questions about Intersect governance as they surface.

### Intersect Governance and Cardano Civics Committee governance

* There was discussion about clarifying the remit of this committee and whether it should cover the governance of Intersect, or if it might be a separate group dedicated to defining and implementing the committee governance standards
* Intersect governance needs highlighted in the meeting included:
  * Process for the members to establish committees and working groups
  * RACI and charters across committee to clarify remits and how they work together
  * Representation: when is a member representing Intersect, member affiliation, recusal, code of conduct
* It was noted that the Community Advisory Board consisting of members has been established and is starting to advise on these standards, starting with the board election process, then working down to committees.
* This committee wants to better define its processes - when and how to vote, how to increase transparency, improved charter.
