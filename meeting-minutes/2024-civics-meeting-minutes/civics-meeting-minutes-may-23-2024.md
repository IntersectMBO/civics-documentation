# Civics Meeting Minutes May 23, 2024

### Interim CC Election Process

* Discussed the interim constitutional committee election process and tradeoffs of several options.
* Motion: Intersect will provide the platform for the interim constitutional committee election. The candidacy is open to anyone as long as they can register on the Summon voting tool. Itâ€™s a two stage system. 1) Register intent to run. 2) Voters will select the top 3 candidates using their stake as weight. The Summon platform will calculate the top 3 candidates by stake weight.  Post election, resources, training, and infrastructural improvements will be provided to the winners (as-needed).  The interim CC term is 73 epochs following the first Chang hard fork.
* Passed unanimously with one abstain (recusal).

### Progress update from Drafting Task Force

* Drafting has focused so far on principles and tenets, with outstanding topics identified to progress the draft.
* Discussed an in-person drafting workshop in late July.

### Progress update from Ratification Task Force

* Supported the Intersect grant process to allow grants for Constitutional workshops to open.
* Next focus will be defining the remaining workshop details and open questions on constitutional delegates.

### Workshop grants evaluation

* Discussed the Intersect grant process and how it uses relevant committees to support evaluation. All except 1 CCC member must recuse themself from evaluating, so other evaluators will be recruited from Intersect membership.
