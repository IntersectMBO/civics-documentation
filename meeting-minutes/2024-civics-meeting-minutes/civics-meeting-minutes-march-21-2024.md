# Civics Meeting Minutes March 21, 2024

### Review of Activities since last meeting

* The committee has made progress on updating its charter, establishing the constitution ratification working group charter, and also understanding the way forward for the Cardano Ecosystem Mapping working group.
* The Governance Parameter Advisory Group is still working on recommendations for the initial governance parameter settings
* The Interim Constitution suggested edits have been recorded in the document
* The Cardano Ecosystem Process working group is being moved forward following the Feb 19/20th workshops.
* Several concerns were discussed regarding the governance of Intersect and its responsiveness to members, which are pertinent to the work of the Community Advisory Board and will continue to evolve in that forum, not this committee.



### Cardano Civics Committee Charter updates for discussion

* The committee reviewed several changes made to its charter, and there was discussion and agreement on adopting the voting process defined by the Community Advisory Board for our first decision. There was also agreement that the process can evolve as we use it and learn what does/not work.
  * It was noted that one of the unique decision making capabilities is for committees to use CIP-1694 to hold community votes if committee members need to make content decisions, and that the Intersect board can resolve structural issues
  * It was also noted that before holding broad elections, a code of conduct and recusal policy should be in place
