# Civics Meeting Minutes February 29, 2024

### Review of Activities since last meeting

* Since last meeting the committee held a workshop in London and did a round robin for reflections
  * Everyone found the face to face time useful
  * They discussed the open source product backlog process for both the existing continuity work and for grassroots development. It was also noted that current backlog needs to be more clearly communicated, and that as an ecosystem, we have some governance failures already with certain projects claiming false results.
  * Discussed the vision work that needs to be done, and the difference between the negative rights as “below the line” and then the human element/why as “above the line”
  * The constitution structure was also discussed, with basic sections suggested to be a preamble, articles for reflecting CIP-1694 and the guardrails, as well as tenets to capture rights.
* The committee has agreed to break work into several working groups. The committee members are also interested in remuneration for their efforts and electing a new chair.
* There was a brief update on the governance parameter advisory group’s recommendation, which has been formed based on community input, and is now going through reviews with some technical and other governance experts
* The committee discussed some new work that might be useful for the DRep working group related to understanding legal liabilities and constraining them with smart contracts. This could lead to technical and legal templates for DReps



### 2024 priorities and working group review

* Immediate priorities:
  * Constitution consultation period and drafting
  * DRep incentives/ incentive design
  * Ecosystem mapping and defining a successful MVP
* Secondary priorities:
  * Cardano treasury budget
  * Monitor initial parameter settings after the hard fork
  * Monitoring tools for on-chain voting to verify that they are maintained and operational
* For working groups, it was discussed that there’s a distinction between internal governance of Intersect and the governance of Cardano. The Cardano Civics Committee should cover the latter.
