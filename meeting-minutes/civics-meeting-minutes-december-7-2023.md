# Civics Meeting Minutes December 7, 2023

### Governance Guardrails Working group summary of conclusions:

* We think the Cardano treasury should be depletionary, as well as a budget agreed to by DReps.
* We also agree that the funds in the treasury pot should not be delegated to SPOs or DReps.
* We are suggesting that a value of X ADA per Y epoch needs to be set, and right now are thinking 2.47% per 12 epochs based on the LATAM community’s research.
  * The number itself does not go in the minimum viable constitution, but rather the rule that this number must be established by the DReps, and when possible, make it a protocol parameter and then sit outside of the constitution
* The working group is hosting community X spaces on some topics to gather diverse perspectives - it’s an open invite for the community to join.



### Informational update about the other committees of Intersect

* There was an overview of the committees within Intersect to provide visibility to the committee members.

  * Define the method for committees to stay connected within Intersect
  * Budget committee work should be in context of broader economics.
  * Exploring how Cardano interacts with capital/monies from outside of the Cardano treasury and ecosystem.
  * Map the RACI of committees within Intersect
