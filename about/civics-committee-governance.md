# Civics Committee Governance

The general decision-making process is (in order):

1. **Consent-based:** just act based on what you think people will want. If nobody objects then everything is fine.&#x20;
2. [**Consensus-building**](https://community.apache.org/committers/consensusBuilding.html)**:** seek indications of consensus from the relevant group
   1. Voting: the relevant group votes explicitly (this is an example of consensus-building since it aims to get the group to come to a more explicit consensus)
3. **Escalation**: the issue is raised to a higher decision-making body if a consensus cannot be reached
   1. Structural issues (e.g. disciplinary action) are escalated to Governing Board
   2. Content issues are escalated to community vote
