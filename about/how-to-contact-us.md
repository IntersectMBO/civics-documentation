# How to Contact Us

**Collaboration Channels**

The working group Discord channels are only open to the working group members. This is because the working groupâ€™s deliverables will all become public once ready, with several undergoing structured community consultation.  The constitution engagement lead (Thomas) will share regular updates on the progress and workshops. \
